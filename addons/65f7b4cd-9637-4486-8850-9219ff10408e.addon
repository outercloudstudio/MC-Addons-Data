The impostor does a massive amount of damage and is a great addition to mob farms. The sus imposter has only 1 hp, but don't let that fool you, his damage makes up for it.#br##br#Where will it spawn?#br#The impostor will spawn in light levels of 7 or less. He is less common than normal monsters so you will have to try a little harder to find him!#br##br#What does it attack?#br#The impostor will attack all living and non-living beings close enough to it.|OuterCloudStudio|OuterCastlesSS1.png|https://outercloudstudio.github.io/impostorAddon.html
